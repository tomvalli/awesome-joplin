## Tools

All of these are mostly sourced from the [#apps
topic](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/c/apps/11) on the [official Joplin
forum](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/c/apps/11).

- [Web Clipper](https://joplinapp.org/clipper/). A browser extension that allows
  you to save web pages and screenshots from your browser. To start using it,
  open the Joplin desktop application, go to the Web Clipper Options and follow
  the instructions.
- [File Uploader and OCR (a.k.a. REST
  Uploader)](https://github.com/kellerjustin/rest-uploader). Command line
  companion application to supplement Joplin. The app monitors a directory you
  specify; when new files are created in the directory, it automatically uploads
  the file as text or an attachment (depending on file type) to a new note in
  Joplin. The app performs OCR on images and PDFs, and the text is dropped into
  the note as a comment. An image preview is also created for PDFs.
- [Python Joplin API](https://github.com/foxmask/joplin-api). The API of Joplin
  Editor in Python 3.6+.
- [Replace Evernote links in
  Joplin](https://github.com/pentop/replaceEvernoteLinksWithJoplin). A script
  which uses the Joplin API to globally search-and-replace Evernote links within
  notes with native Joplin links.
- [Send email from Outlook to
  Joplin](https://gist.github.com/ramisedhom/0f34c5d6a8d73f0b98ac4bea2ec30be0).
  A VBA script (Visual Basic for Application) to send the subject of selected
  emails from Outook to Joplin Desktop.
- [Ghoplin](https://github.com/zblesk/Ghoplin). A tool for downloading posts
  from Ghost blogs into Joplin.

  Note Station and imports them into the Joplin app.
- [joplin-mail-gateway](https://github.com/manolitto/joplin-mail-gateway). This
  tool provides a solution for emailing content directly into your Joplin notes.

  You may send or forward an email to a dedicated email address. This email is
  than automatically delivered to your personal Joplin notes. Attachments (PDFs,
  Images, ...) will automatically be included in the note. In addition text is
  automatically scanned from images via OCR. This extracted text is added at the
  bottom of the note so that it is easily searchable in Joplin.
- [joplin-bulker](https://github.com/andgineer/joplin-bulker). Python script to
  bulk remove tags from Joplin files.
